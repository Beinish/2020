# TwentyTwenty

This app is based on the 20-20-20 rule which you can read about in the links below. Basically, the rule says that every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This will help reduce:

* sore, tired or burning eyes
* blurred or double vision
* watery, itchy or dry eyes
* headaches 

## Installation

1. Extract the .zip file
2. run `pip install requirements.txt`
3. run `app.py`

## Usage

Simply start the app by clicking on "Start", minimize it to your tray and let it run in the background. A notification will pop up every 20 minutes to remind you to look away for the next 20 seconds. Each notification will also play a sound so you'll know when you can look again at the monitor. You also have a tray menu at your disposal:
